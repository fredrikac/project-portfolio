Utkast:
Best advice I ever received is to get into tech. My best friend planted the idea in my mind, and when the pandemic hit and I got laid off I took the opportunity to change career into tech.
Best decision I ever made!

My first coding project was about... I have a ton of more or less finished projects. I think the first project I made and deployed on github pages is a fortune teller app. Super simple, really ugly but kinda funny.


One thing I wish I knew when I first started to code is.. how creative and rewarding it is! I wish someone had told me earlier that coding isn't exclusively for math geniuses. 

Coding taught me the value of grit. Just keep going, stick to it even when it feels impossibly hard. 

Recognize these questions? Maybe you've heard them in the brilliant CodeNewbie podcast.
